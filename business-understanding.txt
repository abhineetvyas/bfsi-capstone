Financial benefit
 - good propspect customers we should not loose,   ()
 - late payement  (low risk profile - default - ) 
 - roll up and roll back


The problem is 
 - The potential customers  are going to default
 - Delinquent vs default customers  [problem statement]
 - consecutive missed 3 EMI - you are delinquent
 - Default customers  - trying to predict - minimize the credit loss
 - Imblance data - fradulent data
 - roll up and roll back   [how to do it because of last year   -   30 days 60 days 90 days DPD]     
       - roll up and roll back chart - at individual customer level
       - customer segmentation based on age, empluymen type ... 
	     group data based  on emobraphic   - age, income, empl    
		    - roll up or roll back at segment level


			
 	   
 - three types of score card
 	-       application score card  - acquisition analytics  []
               - If I approve and find if the customers will default in 
        	 - application data
         	- bureau data
	-	Behavioural score card =  application + transaction + bureau data   (this is not required)

	-	collection score card = whether you are 30, 60, 90 DPD, roll back or roll over

 - CRISIL - provides 
 - CIBIL - provides the bureau data
		- sells the data on a quarterly basis
 - loan history

 Data cleaning and preparation - raman & Nilesh ji

From demographic data 

​1.age -replace all 0 and -ve with WOE 
​2. Education - blanks make all as 'not captured' category 
3.remaining all with NA or zero - delete them  and write the assumption
​4. remove all data with performance tag = NA

CREDIT beuarue 
​1.Presence.of.open.home.loan ---- 
​2.Avgas.CC.Utilization.in.last.12.months-replace NA with WOE
​3.No.of.trades.opened.in.last.6.months-DELETE
​4.No.of.trades.opened.in.last.6.months
​5.Presence.of.open.home.loan-- MAKE values with NA = 0
​6.Outstanding.Balance-- MAKE values with NA = 0




outlier treatment -  Anil ji
 1. for all numerical values having outliers - we have to do data mutation using capping an flooring

Feature selection ---Abhineet 

​ 1.. Calculate p value using Chi square for all categorical variables in the merged data set 
2. Calculate IV for numerical variables 
​3.for the selected features calculate VIF (Multiocllenarity) and remove ones with high >5
